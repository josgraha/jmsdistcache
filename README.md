# JMSDistCache

Simple webapp grabbed from Spring Examples to demonstrate JMS cache replication.  If working correctly one server should fetch from db and populate cache while another server will receive the update via JMS and operate in "cache-only" mode.

## Setup
* start mysql
* start activemq on default port
* seed the database via hibernate.cfg or the sql scripts
* disable autocreation of schema in hibernate.cfg is hiberate initialized db

## Usage

run server 1 using run_server_XX script \<port1\>

edit spring-context.xml

set property of p:cacheOnly="true"

run server 2 using run_server_XY script \<port2\>

load the entry via cache only via webservice on server 1
http://localhost:\<port2\>/jmsdistcache/employee/1

### Expected Result:
No value

create an entry in the employee, department, and employee_department table

load the entry into the cache via webservice on server 2
http://localhost:\<port2\>/jmsdistcache/employee/1

load the entry via cache only via webservice on server 1
http://localhost:\<port2\>/jmsdistcache/employee/1

### Expected Result:
Value loaded via cache on server2 and replication via JMS to server 1


## TODO
Create a unit test to capture the above steps.


## Known Issues
Requires jms-replication version 0.5 dependency.  Will throw NoSuchMethod exceptions on older versions.  Notice the repository location added to the maven build.
